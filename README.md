Project: Excel File Manipulation Backend

Overview

This backend project is designed to provide a robust and efficient API for manipulating Excel files. It leverages powerful libraries and frameworks to handle tasks such as:

Reading Excel files: Extracting data from various Excel formats (XLS, XLSX, etc.).
Writing Excel files: Creating new Excel files or modifying existing ones.
Data manipulation: Performing operations like filtering, sorting, and calculations on data within the Excel files.
Formatting: Applying formatting styles, cell styles, and conditional formatting to enhance the visual representation of data.
